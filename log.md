# Jessica's Super Interesting/Not That Interesting 100 Day Log

### Day 1: June 6th, 2017
Today was a little rough getting going- I have a lot to learn and less time to actually learn it. I chose to work through the arcade section of <a href="https://codefights.com/">Code Fights</a>. I learned a lot about algorythms and also became very frustrated when I was stuck and I had to spen 6,000 coins to get a hint.
